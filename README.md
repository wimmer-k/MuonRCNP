# MuonRCNP

Time stamp sorting, event building, and analysis for MuonRCNP experiment Jan 2018

First a bit of terminology:  
a fragment is a single hit, one board, one channel, either wave form data, or pulse height data  
an event contains several fragments, within the event building window

## Setup:

lines starting with "$" refer to command line commands, starting with "[]" to commands in root

go to the directory
```
$cd ~/work/seamine2018_daq/kathrin
```
set the environment
```
$source setup
```
this set the PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH, the correct root version 6.12,  
and also my emacs environment, make your own setup file, if you donâ€™t want this!

There are two main programs, 'EventBuild' and 'Histos', and two scripts

## EventBuild:
this program takes the raw data and produced a time ordered tree with built and analyzed events
```
$EventBuild
```
gives you some help on the options:  
"-r N" is the run number N, it will automatically read from the proper disk and write the output to ./root/runXXXX.root  
"-s setfile.dat" is to choose the settings file, which contains the settings for the analysis  
"-m M" is the memory depth, the number of fragments M stored in memory for timestamp sorting, if you get warnings that events have to be discarded, increase this number  
"-e E" is the event building window, fragments which are less than E ns away from the last fragment in the current event are added, otherwise a new event is created.  
"-w W" chooses if the waveform is written to the tree, 0 for never, 1 only if the threshold was crossed, 2 always, 3 if threshold not crossed do not write anything 

two other options are more for debugging:  
"-l F" is the last fragment to be read, only F fragments are process then  
"-v V" is the verbose level, the higher V the more stuff is dumped to the screen  

A typical command would be
```
$EventBuild -r 12 -m 20000 -s defaultset.dat
```
you can also use ctrl+c to quit savely, i.e. the fragments will be flushed, events closed, and the file written.

At the end the program gives you a bit of statistics:
```
Status of SortHits:
Event memory depth: 20000
Fragments processed:   2642280
Events built:   198099
writing tree to root file
------------------------------------
Total of 2642280 data fragments (3719 MB) read.
198099 entries written to tree (59 MB)
First time stamp: 19129144, last time stamp: 742731846712, data taking time: 5941.7 seconds.
Program Run time: 130.648 s.
Unpacked 20224.4 fragments/s.
```

## Histos:
The second program produces histograms from the tree
```
$Histos
```
gives you help  
"-i infile" defines the inputfile(s), it can also combine several files into one output  
"-o outfile" the outputfile  
again debugging options are  
"-l L" to read up to event L  
"-v V" verbose level

so far there are spectra for the germanium energies and the BaF pulse height defined.  
More spectra need to be defined.
